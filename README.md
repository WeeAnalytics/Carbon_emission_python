# Carbon emission project - Python/Pandas

In this project, I will analyze the carbon emission data available publicly on https://nature.com to :
1. Explore the carbon footprint of various industries from the most recent year 
2. Determine the highest emitting industries

## About the dataset:

- The original dataset can be found on https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01178-9 under reference pt.31
- Part of the original dataset extracted for the purpose of this project. 
- The new dataset contains the following fields:

```
Original column name                                                

*PCF-ID    
Year of reporting  
Product name (and functional unit)
Company 
Country (where company is incorporated)
*Company's sector 
Product weight (kg)  
Product's carbon footprint (PCF, kg CO2e)
*Upstream CO2e (fraction of total PCF)
*Operations CO2e (fraction of total PCF) 
*Downstream CO2e (fraction of total PCF)
```
